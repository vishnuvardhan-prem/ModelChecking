# ModelChecking
Just a repository of my learnings regarding Model Checking.

Our lives today are extremely reliant on the digital world and as such, it has become crucial to develop techniques to ensure the proper functioning of these digital systems. System
verification is used to establish that a product or design under consideration possess certain
properties. Of the various methods of system verification, our interests lie primarily in the
area of model checking. Through this project, we were hoping to advocate for model checking as a crucial step in the development of both hardware and software systems. With the
extremely high costs involved in the testing and simulation of avionic systems, we found it
extremely suitable to demonstrate the applications of model checking. For this, we designed
a quad redundant voter system and then applied model checking to verify the correctness of
the design.


Please do take a look at the enclosed pdf to understand better our learnings and findings. Also definitely look into the references I used, which allowed us to gain a clearer understanding.
